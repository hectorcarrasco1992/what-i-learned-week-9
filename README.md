## _Functions As A PARAMETER?!!! NANI!??_

    So this week was a pretty mind-blowing week. We learned how to pass in a whole function as a parameter in order to actually put these functions to work.

## _Uptown Func_
* The first project introducing us to the idea of functions as parameteres.

* These were just basic examples to help us conceptualize the idea that a function can be passed into another function.

## __Functulate 

* In this project we expanded on our previous calculator app.
  
* We did this, by making a function that will allow our calculator app to run math problems by only calling on this function.

# _DOM_ _Terreto_

    We need more DOM through projects like extinction even and otheres.
    We did this in order to get a handle on how to use querySelectAll.
